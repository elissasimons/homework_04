# Homework 4 - Coding Quiz

This is my quiz with questions about JavaScript! I had a really tough time with this one. I figured out the basic structure of the quiz, but could not for the life of me figure out how to implement a timer or scorecard. I tried a few things that didn't work and honestly just ran out of time. I would like to revisit this later on.

## Ackowledgements:

I found this great video that showed a step-by-step on how to create a quiz:

I also took this practice quiz on W3schools which helped inspire a few of the questions:
